            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A brief Remembrance When the Report concerning the pretended Ryot in the Iſle of <hi>Axholm</hi> ſhall be read. Humbly tendered to every individual member of Parliament, By the Free-holders and Commoners within the Mannor of <hi>Epworth</hi> in the ſaid Iſle, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber neer 1200. beſides new-erected Cottages. Againſt Certain Undertakers, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Particpants in the drayning of the Level of <hi>Hatfield</hi>-Chaſe; Concerning 7400 acres of Commonable Lands (being no part of the ſaid Chaſe, but lying within the Mannor of <hi>Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>) taken from the Free-holders by the ſaid Undertakers about twenty yeers ſince, under colour of the late Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent contrary to law. And becauſe the Report doth not at all ſet forth the proceedings that have been at Law, therefore the Free-holders humbly inform, as followeth: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat in <hi>Hilary</hi>-Term, 1654. they commenced their Suits at Law againſt the Participants, to try their Title to the ſaid Lands.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1646. (and not in 1642. as the Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pants in their Petition to the late Parliament falſly ſuggeſt) the Participants exhibited and Engliſh Bill in the Exchequer, to ſtay thoſe Suits at Law.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the Decree, and the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Mr. <hi>Say</hi> and Mr. <hi>Darley</hi> the Reporters, in fol. <hi>3.</hi> of the Report, when it ſhall be read, upon that Decree.</note> 1650. that Bill came to full hearing: and the Decree then made, doth eſtabliſh the poſſeſſion no otherwiſe with the Participants then it was when that Bill was exhibited.</p>
            <p>Where <hi>note,</hi> That about 4000 acres of the ſaid 7400 acres had been then about five yeers before the ſaid Bills exhibiting, in the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders poſſeſſion: in which caſe, all reftitution of poſſeſſion, under colour of a Ryot, is by Law excluded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> alſo, That Decree alſo gives way to the Free-holders to go to Tryal at Law for the reſt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term, 1651. the Free-holders, in purſuance of the ſaid Decree, by Order of the Exchequer, had a Tryal at that Bar, in the name of <hi>Thomas Vavaſour</hi> Gent. before which time, the ſuppoſed Ryot was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which <hi>Vavaſour</hi> was no Ryotor.</p>
            <p>There being now about 100 charged as Ryotors, It is humbly ſubmitted, <hi>Whether all the rest of the Free-holders and Commoners, being above a thouſand, ſhall ſuffer the loſs of their poſſeſsion ſo left unto them as aforeſaid by the Decree of</hi> Feb. 1650. <hi>upon the full hearing of the Participants own Bill in equity, and afterwards recovered by the Free-holders at Law, upon a Verdict in the name of one that was no Ryoter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, it is clear by the Depoſitions (if Mr. <hi>Say</hi> have taken them aright, whereof the Free-holders to this day never had copies) that there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the grounds by the ſaid Participants. In all which reſpects, the Free-holders now deſire to be Improvers of their ancient inheritance, both for their own and the Commonwealths good.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:163281:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> The Free-holders alſo humbly inform, That By that partial and wicked contrived Report of Mr. <hi>Say</hi> and Mr. <hi>Darley,</hi> two Members of the late Parliament, the equitable part of the Cauſe ſhall never come to your view, but lie hidden in the Depoſitions, whereof to this day the Free-holders never had copies: whereby it is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, as followeth.
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Undertakers did but at their firſt coming into thoſe parts deſire to cut thorow the Manor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> that is in <hi>Lincoln</hi>-ſhire, to drayn <hi>Hatfield</hi>-Chaſe, and many other Mannors that lie in <hi>York</hi>-ſhire; and that without cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thorow the Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> they could not drayn <hi>Hatfield</hi>-Chaſe and thoſe other Mannors.</item>
                  <item>2. That they have been at no more charge within the Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> then in making one Drayn of four miles in length; and that in ſtead thereof, they have ſtopped up ſome old Sewers, and diverted the courſe of an ancient Navigable River called <hi>Idle</hi> within the ſaid Mannor; and that the South part of the Mannor is as ſubject to be ſurrounded with water as it was before the pretended Drayning.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Lands before the pretended Drayning was worth 10 <hi>s.</hi> an acre <hi>per an.</hi> one with another thorowout; and that 3000 acres of the 7400 acres which the Undertakers took from the Free holders, lying towards the North ſide of the Mannor, was worth xx <hi>s.</hi> an acre <hi>per an.</hi> before the pretended dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and 2000 acres more thereof, lying towards the South, was worht 15 <hi>s.</hi> and acre yeerly.</item>
                  <item>4. That the Participants took all the beſt ground, and left the Free-holders the very worſt.</item>
                  <item>5. That the grounds before the Drayning fed all manner of Cattel far for the Butcher.</item>
                  <item>6. That the Free-holders cannot keep half ſo many cattel levant and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that is, winter and ſummer, upon their tenements, as they could before the pretended Drayning, but are enforced to Joyſt their Cattel in forraign places, and turn their Meadow grounds into paſture.</item>
                  <item>7. That in that reſpect, divers ſold their eſtates within the ſaid Mannor, and bought and went to live elſewhere out of the Mannor.</item>
                  <item>8. That the grounds, before the pretended Drayning, was better in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by reaſon of the overflowing of water in winter.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>All which Mr. <hi>Say</hi> and Mr. <hi>Darley</hi> have concealed in their Report, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withholding the truth, to induce your Honours the more readily to believe there is an improvement; whereas indeed there is none: ſo as unleſs your Honors take care that the Depoſitions be thorowly peruſed, or that the Free-holders may have copies thereof, to make their Exceptions to the ſaid Report, they are likely to be undone through ignorance, as they have been already in a great meaſure; the Books either not being thorowly peruſed, or not returned in to the Councel as they were firſt taken, or ought to have been taken by Mr. <hi>Say;</hi> which we have occaſion to ſuſpect, in reſpect of a ſecond Report now made to the Councel, as alſo by ſome ſpeeches that late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been divulged by ſome of the adverſe party to that purpoſe.</p>
